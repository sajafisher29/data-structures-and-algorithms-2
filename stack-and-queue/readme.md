# Stacks and Queues
Implementation: Stacks and Queues. This package is stacks and queues built from scratch to illustrate how they work.

## Challenge
The challenge was to build from scratch both stacks and queues and all their methods. As well as all of the tests to ensure that they work.

## Approach & Efficiency
I built this in the simplist most standard way I could think of. I didn't use generics, they aren't very complicated and I just thought it would be simpler to just use ints.

## API
LinkedList class:
  - peek(): Returns the value of the head of the list.
  - isEmpty(): Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the list is empty.

Stack class:
 - push(): Pushes a new value onto the stack
 - pop(): Pops the node off the head of the stack and returns the value

 Queue class:
  - enqueue(): Adds a node to the tail of the queue.
  - dequeue(): removes the node from the head and returns the value.
