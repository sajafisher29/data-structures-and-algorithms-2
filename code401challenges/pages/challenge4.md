## Challenge
Create a LinkedList and Node class and use them to instantiate linked lists. Write several methods which manipulate
and/or show output of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
I did it probably the only way that you can. I watched some youtube videos and then I wrote the methods.
I don't think there is another way besides creating a new node, setting the head and next, etc.

## API
1. insert(): Inserts a new node as the head of the linked list
2. showString(): returns a string that shows the structure of the linked list.
3. includes: Returns a boolean depending on if the input value is in the linked list.
