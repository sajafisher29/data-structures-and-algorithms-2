## Challenge
Write three more methods on the linked list class. Append value, insertBefore, and insertAfter.

## Approach & Efficiency
All of the methods must loop through the link list, and then either find a specific value and create a node or
just append a new value to the end. I would say I used about 50% test driven development.

## API
1. append(value): Appends a node with a specific value to the end of the list.
2. insertBefore(value, newval): Finds a specific value in a linked list and inserts a new node with a new value
before that node.
3. insertBefore(value, newVal): It does the same thing as insertBefore, but it adds the node after the value.
